- Radial attack you have to jump over
    - Once hit, get marked with timer
    - When timer runs out, radius removes lots of spread
    - This allows players to defend against spread removal if they miss the jump

- Multiple spread types
    - Already have weeds
    - Can just be a visual based on player state (ie. one type on ski, another on walk, etc.)
