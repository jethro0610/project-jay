- Sea Dock Bells 

- Big Yellow Cross thing, not sure what it'll do (see test_skel)

- Effect that launches light beams that keep target in air, multi-hit
    - Can use this to combo

- Some enemies break combo when hit with meteor
    - Maybe certain number of meteors only?
    - Or when you do the same action twice they break
        - Air Meteor and ground meteor count as two different actions
        - Spread should play into this somehow

    - Then some effects can reset this counter

- Rock -> Meteor -> Light Beam -> Rock -> Meteor -> Meteor

- When you hit certain objects off level, they'll come right back, aimed someplace where the player can
  easily hit them. This will reward high speeds and ring outs on items that need to broken (ie. rocks)

- EVERYTHING needs to be big due to the filter and terrain
- Rocks will NOT roll/slide, just dig back into the ground when they throw
- The level design will use large "pillars" that the player weaves around
  unitl they want to interact with it. ie. rock clusters

- On light level: pillar that absorbs seed when near (has priority)
  lights up area
    - Maybe just force any spread to break near it in intervals
    - Can design a boss around this mechanic too

- Enemy that stomps, steps on rock like legos to damage
    - How to get it to target on spot, should player stop and boost somehow?

- Enemy that only gets defeated when spread is placed in area

- When a meteor occurs, shockwave happens on collision, this is what actually deals the damage

- The parameters below create a streaking effect on the terrain. Could be a
cool visual later on. float fresnel = GetFresnel(cameraPos,
outVert.worldPosition.xyz, lightDir, normal, 4.0f, 64.0f); fresnel =
min(fresnel, 1.0f); fresnel *= 0.9f;     

- Player and other chars are blurry due to the paint filter. Skipping them in
the filter may look better. This could be done with the stencil buffer.

- Some kind of perma growth mechanic that grows and prevents spread from
taking its space

- Rivers?

- Fire spread

- Cutting the spread for benefits ie. speed, stop fire

- Enemy that launches fireballs that rain down and destroy spread

- Some constant properties on holdable so they move with the property ie.
  spreading

- When you slow down, certain parts of the world "unghost".
    - Basically shows hint, story of the is`land, etc.

- Each island level has its own story

- Some wind ability that magnets stuff toward you

- Spread that reflects the sky, shows soemthing

- Spread that lights up to reveal the dark

- Levels have pre-placed spread, cut and move the seeds

- Meteoric speed effect where if you go fast enough you can bump people hard
    - Crash into enemy to stun for a while, but removes your own speed

- Music bells

- Enemy that slowly follows you
    - Have an obstacle in the level that slow you down

- Level where you form terrain pits to round up object

- Mole that goes underground and modifies terrain
    - Player needs to modify terrain too to beat them

- Enemy that stabs the world and pokes a hole through it
    - Some rounding quest with these present, keep other entities alive

- Badge that puts interval spawner on player, spawns something

- Hover highlight like Mario Galaxy?
- Fall colored spread that grows under trees
    - Trees can be knocked down with meteor effect
    - Trees give some resource when dropped
    
- Interval spawning enemy that pops up and disappears in random spots

- Kick on ground = knockback (reverse grounded veloicty), maybe launch
    - Can have entity shock if stop effect is wanted
- Kick in air = throw 

- Wind waker style light and shadow colors (lerp to values)

- Bouncy ball projectile that has to be dodged (super low gravity and movement,
  high count)

- Tunicate squirter

- Level where tide rises and falls
    - Some stuff on high
    - Others on low
    - Different benefits for each

- Kickable that forms wall in the air, if anything hits the wall, dead

- Ring a bell to go to next level
    - Lots of reverb

- Add some kind of action on hard turn

- Store world WVP matrix off by a few frames so it appears behind in time 

- Somwthing you hit in air

- Object that explodes nearly instantly on contanct, harms player
    - Player can pivot away to avoid

- Objects that activate when jumped off of
    - Give seeds
    - Modify world
    - Bigger spread
    - Temporary ability (magent)

- Mole that lifts ground whenever popped out
    - Hella big

- Since each entity has some spread meter, have them release the meter on death
  to pickup

- Spread meter is basically enemy HP

- Balloon to pop that give spread meter

- Enemies can break spread to gain meter

- Converts meter to ie. homing thing

- Meter particles falling from sky 

- Moving enemies that follow different paths ie. circle, line, zigzag

- Water gun that sprays meter

- Add HP component, maybe store meter and when it runs out or reaches threshold,
  do an action

- Some way to stop captures as they happen, so seeds are left floating

- On seed touch ground, re-randomize bounce

- Projectile ground sliding
    - Likely need to make a general grounding/friction system not apart of the
      projectile system
