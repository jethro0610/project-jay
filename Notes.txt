-   Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be better to use indexes per level 
    to link the assets. Either that or just use mapped IDs.
    -   The main thing with per level indexing is keeping loaded assets between levels and keeping their index

-   Indices may actually be fine, but texture arrays are going to use indexes. Maybe have a map of strings to index?
-   If the string mapping is too slow, the asset manager can just generate indices that the models themselves hold
    or the strings can be hashed at runtime and only store the indices

-   TextureArrays per level can be implemented instead of switching resources every render

-   Sparse Arrays for the ECS is likely necessary to safe on memory and prevent updating unused components
    -   Tracking the active entity indices would be helpful in preventing unecessary updates as well if Sparse Arrays 
        will not be used

-   Removing the template on the EntityManager and Entity may also be beneficial for the sake of program 
    simplicty. Furthermore, a loop is used to determine what components the Entity has, but using Component::ID is simpler

-   Camera needs to collide with world

-   Camera interpolation fix

-   Asset building

-   Remove new calls on Game member classes, creat Init functions instead

-	Right now every shader get compiled by the compiler script, need someway to log the last compile time and recompile when necessary

-   The parameters below create a streaking effect on the terrain. Could be a cool visual later on.
    float fresnel = GetFresnel(cameraPos, outVert.worldPosition.xyz, lightDir, normal, 4.0f, 64.0f);
    fresnel = min(fresnel, 1.0f);
    fresnel *= 0.9f;     

-   Player and other chars are blurry due to the paint filter. Skipping them in the filter may look better. This could be done with the
    stencil buffer.

-   Entity for base islands

-   World Render Target
        - Might just use simple, position based plant movement instead. Simpler and more mem-efficient

-   Use bitmask comparison for entity ownership (bitmask & componentMask)

-   Rename Inputs.h to PlayerInputs.h, maybe rename variables to match with InputComponent

-   Some kind of perma growth mechanic that grows and prevents spread from taking its space

-   Rivers?

-   Enemies?

-   Some spread bomb, but it flattens the terrain as a result

-   Projectiles
    -   Needs target component to follow a given entity 
    -   Recieve input from somewhere 
    -   Apply velocity using new VelocitySystem instead of MovementSystem
    -   Separate component or apart of MovementComponent?

-   Hitbox system
    -   Hitboxes have flags that indicate behavior (RecieveKick, SpreadOnKick, DestroyOnKick, StopProjectileOnWorld, etc.)
    -   Some kind of behavior system based on those flags
    -   Remove radius from ProjectileComponent, maybe add radius to world collider?
    -   Rename to interaction bubble?

-   Need some way to sleep components

- Should holds be linked to hitbox?

- Move holds and projectile states to hitbox

- For components that are a single variable, just use a general state and properties component

- Fire spread

- Cutting the spread for benefits ie. speed, stop fire

- Enemy that launches fireballs that rain down and destroy spread

- Some constant properties on holdable so they move with the property ie. spreading

- Should kick be a button or automatic

- Seed system
    - Need seeds to give spread
    - Seed bags that are necessary to hold a seed
    - Seeds are disperese with some kind of entity
    - Cutting spread gives seeds back
    - Each spread type have different properties

- When you slow down, certain parts of the world "unghost".
    - Basically shows hint, story of the is`land, etc.

- Each island level has its own story

- Some wind ability that magnets stuff toward you

- Should cut and kick be the same button?

- Spread that reflects the sky, shows soemthing

- Spread that lights up to reveal the dark

- Levels have pre-placed spread, cut and move the seeds

- Meteoric speed effect where if you go fast enough you can bump people hard
    - Crash into enemy to stun for a while, but removes your own speed

- Music bells

- Enemy that slowly follows you
    - Have an obstacle in the level that slow you down

- Level where you form terrain pits to round up object

- Mole that goes underground and modifies terrain
    - Player needs to modify terrain too to beat them

- Effect that only works on flat terrain. Probably on an enemy

- Enemy that stabs the world and pokes a hole through it
    - Some rounding quest with these present, keep other entities alive

- Badge that puts interval spawner on player, spawns something

- Reflection necessary to see things falling from the sky
    - Only reflects on flat terrain
    - Spread that reflects from straight above

- IMPLEMENT: Hover highlight like Mario Galaxy?
- Fall colored spread that grows under trees
    - Trees can be knocked down with meteor effect
    - Trees give some resource when dropped
    
- Interval spawning enemy that pops up and disappears in random spots

- Kick on ground = knockback (reverse grounded veloicty), maybe launch
    - Can have entity shock if stop effect is wanted
- Kick in air = throw
