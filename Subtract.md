- Problem: How do we define the win condition of the game?

- What feels intrisically good?
    - Weaving around and moving in the level
    - Circle weaves
    - Hitting stuff

- Spread
    - Pros:
        - Feels good to paint the level
        - Encourages players to take multiple "routes"
        - Gives levels a good length
    - Cons:
        - Very difficult to expand upon (at least in my head)
        - Levels may feel homogenous
        - How can I introduce a more varied win condition?
        - When introducing a secondary win condition, levels feels "fuzzy"; players have to juggle two things at once
            - Maybe this is a good thing?
    - Solutions:
        - Have anothing entity in the level creating weeds that the player competes against
        - Have objects to hit that create more spread
        - Allow multiple clears per phase, then have locked time (most points till time up)
            - This may get annoying and feel like padding though
        - Issues with below: what does this have to do with movement?
            - Have objects that remove spread that player has to get rid of
            - Have objects that prevent spread from forming
        - Items that change how player moves (ie. mushroom, jumper)
        - Have spread count towards meter, AND have seeds count towards meter too
            - This could give players more options on how to beat a level
            - Some levels could be seed preventative, so players have to only do spread
            - While others can have lots of weeds implictly, so players have to do seeds
            - Items to remove weeds may be interesting for some levels
            - Maybe make growing spread release seeds too?
            - Makes hitting and spreading feel a little more disconnected though
                - Could make design easier however
            - How do I make it clear what is happening?
                - Difference between which is adding to clearance bar
            - One could end up being more important than the other, players ignore part of the game then
            - Compared to increased spread system, there will now be two goals instead of one with a secondary
            - Maybe have a minimum spread amount?
            - This feels like I'm overcomplicating the design
        - Core design: Spread as much on level, while other things stop you (obstacles)
            - Kinda boring
            - Hard to sustain a full game around
            - Could maybe make for a set of levels at the start?
        - Variable win conditions per level
            - Makes for lots of variety (ie. We Love Katamari)
            - Requires more work to quantify win conditions
            - Would likely need short levels
        - Have lock objects that player needs to interact with in some way before clearing a level
            - Give a fixed amount rather than arbitrary point assignment to seeds
            - Only one meter to keep track of
            - Could allow for boss only levels
            - Good movement should make the locks easier to clear
            - Issue: a lot more disconnected from spread
        - Have spread meter be permanent gain
        - Lock objects add a "ring" of meter instead of preventing clearance

- The game needs some element of randomness to be interesting

- Multiphase levels are pretty ass, but need continuity between short levels to keep the pace up

- The core of the problem: Players need to both interact with the enviornment and spread as much in the arena
- What solution covers both these criteria
- What is the core design of the game. Put it in a sentence:
    - High speed gardening
    - Flow state

- Enemy Clearance
    - Pros:
        - Encourages hitting
        - Can have varied enemies = varied challenges
        - Different win conditions per enemy type
    - Cons:
        - Hard to scale, need different enemies per level
        - Enemies would have to be tanky
        - No incentive to explore movement mechanics
        - Feels generic
