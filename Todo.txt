- Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be
    better to use indexes per level to link the assets. Either that or just use
    mapped IDs.

      levels and keeping their index

- Camera needs to collide with world

- Tree:
    - Enemy that breaks the tree
    - Add fruit spawning with random positions
