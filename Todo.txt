- Remove normal from WorldVS
- Remove _P
- Privatize some variables
- Fix Xbox Series controller on Linux
- Clean up dependencies
- Rename to World to Terrain

- Transition config in skeleton component
- Use GLB

- Some enemies stay in center, others at border

- Animation for up and strong hits
- Each character comes back unless the player takes them
  out in a level
    - Stun enemies without killing
    - What about "vermin" ie. stuff just getting in the way

- Each level is an episode
- Characters you haven't seen interact will at some point in
  weird ways

- Hitbox clank
- Enemy model
- Enemy spread removal
- Enemy jumP
- Freeze emitters with entity

- Projectiles are hittable too, as up and strong hits
- Add reflecting hits
- Rework projectiles

- Nosise texture sample on CPU
- Spread array instead of map

- Object that spurts out and player has to destroy it.
    - After some time, the object creates a permiter that slows player and removes spread

- Skating uphill creates a brake state
    - Spawn particles
    - Special animation (can reuse it in turn around brake)
    - Special jump / attack features

- Action keyframes to spawn particles

- Convert discards to alpha

- Use color uniform for seed

- Seperate assets from Renderer

- Trails and particles system
    - Particle groups

- Hittable that clears way more spread on landing, but gives
  lots of seed. Also does more damage

- Enemy where you hit it, it poofs away. Then you have to chase it
  down to get a full combo/finish

- Pillars that shoot out fire when an object is over it
    - Combo: Launch -> Burned over pillar -> Hit after burn

- Going fast = ghost dimension
- Going slow = human dimension
- Changes interactions

- "Goomba"
    - Grow flowers around them? They take a second then burst
    - Hit them after the burst

- To exit level, player must have grown certain number of flowers
    - If some get cut the exit disappears
    - This means a player can stun enemies instead of elim
    - Elim gives lots of meter however
    - ie. player makes exit, but enemy takes out flower to prevent leaving

- How force boss fights with flower exit system?

- Attack button?
    - High attack (follow up, no homing)
    - Low attack (too fast to follow up, homing)
    - Burst jump large AOE high attack and homing?
    - Attack uses meter?
    - Only low attack can finish
    - High attack in air does more damage than a low attack

- "Goomba"
    - 2/3 hits to destroy
    - Walk around
    - Destroys seed in a radius
    - Jumps occasionally (really high)?

- Gust cut enemy
    - Blows large beam that cuts lots of spread down

- Release ski to hit
- Fog
- Crystal
- Usables
- Raining seed
- Bloom
- Ground moving cutter enemy (leafy disk)

- const refs for strings

- Optimize seed position calculation
    - World Height taking the most time, optimize that
        - Maybe pregenerate the noise and just use bilinear filtering
    - Worst case takes around 1.3ms

- Optimize Skeleton pose calculation
    - Going from Matrix -> Transform -> Matrix is inefficient. How to avoid this?    
    - Figure out some way to lerp Mat4?
    - Converting Transform to Mat4 takes the most time, specifically the multiplication
    - Or can just calculate a few skeletons every few ticks, then interpolate poses
    - Precompute bones in model space instead of local space?

- Flower model
    - Bending
    - Reduce overdraw with mesh shape

- Enemy
- Holes (terrain modification)

- Frustum culling

- Spawn list
- Store loaded entities in resource manager and copy instead of reconstructing
  from json

- Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be
    better to use indexes per level to link the assets. Either that or just use
    mapped IDs.
    - The main thing with per level indexing is keeping loaded assets between
      levels and keeping their index

- Camera needs to collide with world

- Instances need to have an ID

- Tree:
    - Enemy that breaks the tree
    - Add fruit spawning with random positions
    - Fruits can act as buffs ie. magnet

- Stump:
    - Not sure how it will interact

- Breakable bush (meter pad basically)
    - Tree probably better since height is necessary
    - Random offsets in interval spawner
