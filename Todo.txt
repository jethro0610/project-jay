- Remove _P
- Privatize some variables
- Fix Xbox Series controller on Linux
- Clean up dependencies
- Rename to World to Terrain

- Tree:
    - Genericize radius spawning
    - Add fruit spawning with random positions
    - Fruits can act as buffs ie. magnet

- Stump:
    - Not sure how it will interact

- Breakable bush (meter pad basically, regrows)
    - Version that doesn't regrow
    - Tree probably better since height is necessary
    - Yo, maybe enemeis can break the regrowing ones?
    - Random offsets in interval spawner

- Holes (terrain modification)
- Enemy
- Flower model
- Shadow mapping
- Player model
    - Animation

- Spawn list
- Store loaded entities in resource manager and copy instead of reconstructing
  from json

- Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be
    better to use indexes per level to link the assets. Either that or just use
    mapped IDs.
    - The main thing with per level indexing is keeping loaded assets between
      levels and keeping their index

- Camera needs to collide with world
