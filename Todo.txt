- Remove normal from WorldVS
- Remove _P
- Privatize some variables
- Fix Xbox Series controller on Linux
- Clean up dependencies
- Rename to World to Terrain

- Submodules for Libraries
- const refs for strings

- Optimize seed position calculation
    - World Height taking the most time, optimize that
        - Maybe pregenerate the noise and just use bilinear filtering
    - Worst case takes around 1.3ms

- Possible skeleton GPU optimization:
    Currently skeletons calculate with model matrix, but we can apply this
    on the CPU to all the bones to save on matrix multiplications in the GPU.
    Profile later

- Model Spec
    - Model Header:
        Num Meshes
        Num Joints

    - (n) Mesh Header:
        Num Vertices
        Num Indieces

    - (n) Mesh
        - Transform Data
        - Only if its skeletal: 
            - Joints its affected by (4 max)
            - Joint weights

    - (i) Joint
        - Transform Data
        - Inverse Bind Matrix
        - Num Children 
        - Children In Contiguous Sequence

- Animation:
    - Make base pose animation 0 instead

- Flower model
    - Bending
    - Reduce overdraw with mesh shape

- Enemy
- Player model
    - Animation
- Holes (terrain modification)

- Frustum culling

- Spawn list
- Store loaded entities in resource manager and copy instead of reconstructing
  from json

- Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be
    better to use indexes per level to link the assets. Either that or just use
    mapped IDs.
    - The main thing with per level indexing is keeping loaded assets between
      levels and keeping their index

- Camera needs to collide with world

- Instances need to have an ID

- Tree:
    - Enemy that breaks the tree
    - Add fruit spawning with random positions
    - Fruits can act as buffs ie. magnet

- Stump:
    - Not sure how it will interact

- Breakable bush (meter pad basically)
    - Tree probably better since height is necessary
    - Random offsets in interval spawner
