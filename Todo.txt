- Rename to World to Terrain

- Material rewrite
    - Handle non-shadowing materials
    - Material properties
    - Generic mapped color material
    - 0 fresnel on rocks
    - Genericize:
        - Color
        - Instances need to have an ID
        - Masked alpha
        - Defaults material
        - This should use uniforms to add variation between materials

- Enemy
- Player model
    - Animation
- Holes (terrain modification)

- Add negative backside bool to material

- Frustum culling

- Spawn list
- Store loaded entities in resource manager and copy instead of reconstructing
  from json

- Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be
    better to use indexes per level to link the assets. Either that or just use
    mapped IDs.
    - The main thing with per level indexing is keeping loaded assets between
      levels and keeping their index

- Camera needs to collide with world

- Tree:
    - Enemy that breaks the tree
    - Add fruit spawning with random positions
    - Fruits can act as buffs ie. magnet

- Stump:
    - Not sure how it will interact

- Breakable bush (meter pad basically)
    - Tree probably better since height is necessary
    - Random offsets in interval spawner
