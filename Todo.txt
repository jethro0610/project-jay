- Remove normal from WorldVS
- Remove _P
- Privatize some variables
- Fix Xbox Series controller on Linux
- Clean up dependencies
- Rename to World to Terrain

- Each animation stores framerate 
- Animations evaulate every 60 frames
- Presented based on animation framerate

- Release ski to hit
- Fog
- Crystal
- Usables
- Raining seed
- Bloom
- Ground moving cutter enemy (leafy disk)

- Submodules for Libraries
- const refs for strings

- Optimize seed position calculation
    - World Height taking the most time, optimize that
        - Maybe pregenerate the noise and just use bilinear filtering
    - Worst case takes around 1.3ms

- Optimize Skeleton pose calculation
    - Going from Matrix -> Transform -> Matrix is inefficient. How to avoid this?    
    - Figure out some way to lerp Mat4?
    - Converting Transform to Mat4 takes the most time, specifically the multiplication
    - Or can just calculate a few skeletons every few ticks, then interpolate poses
    - Precompute bones in model space instead of local space?

- Flower model
    - Bending
    - Reduce overdraw with mesh shape

- Enemy
- Holes (terrain modification)

- Frustum culling

- Spawn list
- Store loaded entities in resource manager and copy instead of reconstructing
  from json

- Assets are being linked using their actual filenames. It'll probably be
    better to use indexes per level to link the assets. Either that or just use
    mapped IDs.
    - The main thing with per level indexing is keeping loaded assets between
      levels and keeping their index

- Camera needs to collide with world

- Instances need to have an ID

- Tree:
    - Enemy that breaks the tree
    - Add fruit spawning with random positions
    - Fruits can act as buffs ie. magnet

- Stump:
    - Not sure how it will interact

- Breakable bush (meter pad basically)
    - Tree probably better since height is necessary
    - Random offsets in interval spawner
